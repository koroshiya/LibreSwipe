# LibreSwipe
A free, open source, swipe-oriented app drawer for Android.

LibreSwipe is an app drawer which opens by swiping your finger from the side of the screen, like an in-app navigation drawer.

You are then shown a scrollable list of the applications installed on your device, which you can tap to open, or long-tap to view the application's info page.


#### LibreSwipe features:
<ul>
<li>global presence, so you can open LS from anywhere, even inside other apps</li>
<li>several settings, including the side of the screen to swipe from, the appearance of the drawer, and so on</li>
<li>pinned apps, so your favorite apps show up the top of the app drawer</li>
<li>hidden apps, so your drawer isn't cluttered with apps you never use</li>
</ul>



#### Drawbacks and limitations:
<ul>
<li>LS currently overrides other applications' navigation drawers</li>
</ul>



## Usage

To start LibreSwipe, tap on the "LibreSwipe" icon. This will open its main menu.

Once there, tap on "Turn LibreSwipe on/off".

You will see a notification on the bottom of your screen, after which point you will be able to swipe from the left (by default) edge of the screen to open the app drawer.
